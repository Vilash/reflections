What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is stored in the directory
It contains the metadata
It also creates a staging area to add files in repository
It does not do any automatic commit
By initializing a repository one can use git version control system

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think if offers?
SA contain only added files WD all the files
We can make commits based on similarities of logic.
