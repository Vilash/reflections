Lesson 3 Reflections file

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To upload my code to create a backup
To share my code with other contributors on the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually I have the liberty of pulling or pushing the update after they are complete
Whereas If done automatically I would pull unfinished work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: copy someone's repo to your github repo
Clone: copy from github to local
branches: labelling a sequence of commits.
